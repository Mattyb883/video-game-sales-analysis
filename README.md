## Project Description

Ice, an online video game store, wants to analyze historical sales data to understand what makes a game successful. By exploring patterns in genre, platform, region, and reviews, this analysis will guide 2017 marketing strategies and future releases.

## Step 1: General Data Overview
Initial inspection of the dataset including column types, structure, and missing values.

## Step 2: Data Preparation
- Standardized column names
- Converted datatypes
- Addressed missing and anomalous values (e.g., `TBD`)
- Calculated `total_sales` across all regions

## Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Game Releases by Year
Distribution of game releases across years and assessment of data completeness.

### Platform Sales and Lifespan
Top-performing platforms, emergence and decline timelines, and relevance for prediction.

### Sales Distribution by Platform
Box plots of global sales per platform to understand spread and outliers.

### Review Score Impact
Correlation between user and critic scores vs. global sales across multiple platforms.

### Genre Profitability
Most and least profitable genres based on total and average sales.

## Step 4: Regional User Profiles
- Top 5 platforms and genres per region (NA, EU, JP)
- ESRB rating impact on regional sales
- Visualized with pie charts for clarity

## Step 5: Hypothesis Testing
- Tested if Xbox One and PC user ratings are statistically similar
- Tested if user ratings for Action and Sports genres are statistically different
- Included null/alternative hypotheses and significance interpretation

## Step 6: Project Conclusion
Summary of insights, strategic recommendations, and key takeaways for Iceâ€™s business decisions.

## Technical Notes
- Programming language: Python
- Libraries used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
- All monetary figures are in **USD millions**
